## Procedure

Follow these step-by-step instructions to understand and explore the Roofline Performance Model using the interactive simulator.

### Step 1: Understanding the Interface

1. **Observe the Initial Setup**
   - Notice the main roofline chart area with logarithmic axes
   - The X-axis represents Operational Intensity (FLOP/Byte)
   - The Y-axis represents Performance (GFLOP/s)
   - Pre-configured architecture profiles are available in the dropdown

2. **Familiarize with the Components**
   - **Architecture Selector**: Choose between Apple Silicon, Intel Xeon, NVIDIA GPU, or Custom
   - **Roofline Chart**: Interactive visualization with moveable points
   - **Performance Controls**: Sliders for memory bandwidth and compute capability
   - **Application Plotter**: Interface to add computational workloads to the chart
   - **Analysis Panel**: Shows bottleneck identification and optimization suggestions

### Step 2: Basic Roofline Construction

1. **Start with Apple Silicon M1**
   - Select **Apple Silicon M1** from the architecture dropdown
   - Observe the pre-configured roofline with:
     - Memory bandwidth: 68.25 GB/s
     - Peak performance: 2.6 TFLOP/s
     - Ridge point automatically calculated

2. **Understand the Roofline Shape**
   - Notice the diagonal line representing memory bandwidth limitation
   - Observe the horizontal line representing compute capability ceiling
   - Identify the ridge point where these two lines intersect
   - The ridge point = Peak Performance / Memory Bandwidth

3. **Explore Different Architectures**
   - Switch to **Intel Xeon** and observe different characteristics
   - Try **NVIDIA GPU** to see high-performance computing capabilities
   - Notice how different architectures have different performance profiles

### Step 3: Interactive Roofline Modification

1. **Use Custom Configuration**
   - Select **Custom** from the architecture dropdown
   - Adjust the **Memory Bandwidth** slider (1-1000 GB/s range)
   - Modify the **Compute Capability** slider (0.1-100 TFLOP/s range)
   - Watch the roofline shape change in real-time

2. **Analyze Ridge Point Changes**
   - Experiment with different bandwidth and compute ratios
   - Notice how increasing bandwidth shifts the ridge point left
   - Observe how increasing compute capability shifts the ridge point right
   - Understand the implications for different application types

### Step 4: Application Performance Analysis

1. **Plot Basic Applications**
   - Click anywhere on the roofline chart to add an application point
   - Try plotting points in different regions:
     - Below the diagonal (memory-bound region)
     - Above the diagonal but below ceiling (unattainable region)
     - On the horizontal ceiling (compute-bound region)

2. **Analyze Predefined Workloads**
   - Use the application selector to add common workloads:
     - **Vector Addition**: Low operational intensity, memory-bound
     - **Dense Matrix Multiplication**: High operational intensity, potentially compute-bound
     - **Sparse Matrix Operations**: Medium operational intensity
     - **FFT Operations**: Variable intensity based on size

3. **Interpret Results**
   - Applications below the roofline are memory-bound
   - Applications on the ceiling are compute-bound
   - Points above the roofline are theoretically unattainable

### Step 5: Bottleneck Identification

1. **Memory-Bound Analysis**
   - Plot or select a memory-bound application (low operational intensity)
   - Read the analysis panel recommendations:
     - Cache optimization strategies
     - Data layout improvements
     - Algorithmic restructuring suggestions

2. **Compute-Bound Analysis**
   - Plot or select a compute-bound application (high operational intensity)
   - Observe optimization suggestions:
     - Vectorization opportunities
     - Parallelization strategies
     - Algorithmic complexity reduction

3. **Ridge Point Applications**
   - Plot applications near the ridge point
   - Understand that these applications are transitional
   - Learn about balanced optimization approaches

### Step 6: Architecture Comparison

1. **Side-by-Side Analysis**
   - Plot the same application on different architectures
   - Switch between Apple Silicon, Intel Xeon, and NVIDIA GPU
   - Compare where the same workload falls on different rooflines

2. **Optimization Strategy Differences**
   - Memory-bound applications benefit more from high-bandwidth architectures
   - Compute-bound applications benefit from high peak performance systems
   - Understand architecture selection criteria for different workloads

### Step 7: Advanced Analysis Scenarios

1. **Multi-Level Memory Hierarchy**
   - Understand that real systems have multiple rooflines for different memory levels
   - L1 cache provides highest bandwidth but lowest capacity
   - Main memory provides highest capacity but lowest bandwidth per core
   - Each level creates its own performance ceiling

2. **Scaling Analysis**
   - Consider how applications scale with problem size
   - Small problems often memory-bound (low cache reuse)
   - Large problems may become compute-bound (high cache reuse)
   - Very large problems may become memory-bound again (exceed cache capacity)

### Step 8: Performance Optimization Workflow

1. **Baseline Measurement**
   - Start by plotting your application's current performance
   - Identify whether it's memory-bound or compute-bound
   - Note the distance from the roofline (optimization potential)

2. **Strategy Selection**
   - For memory-bound applications:
     - Focus on cache optimization and data locality
     - Consider data structure reorganization
     - Implement cache blocking techniques
   - For compute-bound applications:
     - Focus on vectorization and parallelization
     - Consider algorithmic improvements
     - Optimize for specific instruction sets

3. **Implementation and Verification**
   - Apply selected optimization strategies
   - Re-measure and re-plot performance
   - Verify movement toward the roofline
   - Iterate until satisfactory performance achieved

### Step 9: Real-World Application Examples

1. **Scientific Computing**
   - Climate modeling (typically memory-bound)
   - Molecular dynamics (mixed characteristics)
   - Finite element analysis (varies with mesh size)

2. **Machine Learning**
   - Training (often memory-bound due to large models)
   - Inference (can be compute-bound with optimization)
   - Data preprocessing (typically memory-bound)

3. **Graphics and Gaming**
   - Rasterization (memory-bound for high resolutions)
   - Ray tracing (compute-intensive)
   - Physics simulation (mixed characteristics)

### Step 10: Performance Analysis Report

1. **Document Your Findings**
   - Record baseline performance measurements
   - Note optimization strategies applied
   - Document performance improvements achieved
   - Analyze cost-benefit of different approaches

2. **Compare Across Architectures**
   - Evaluate the same workload on different systems
   - Consider price-performance ratios
   - Factor in power consumption and efficiency
   - Make informed hardware selection decisions
