To understand and analyze the Roofline Performance Model for computational performance optimization. This experiment aims to:

1. **Understand Performance Bounds**: Learn how the Roofline model visualizes theoretical performance upper bounds based on the interplay between memory bandwidth and computational throughput across different computer architectures.

2. **Analyze Operational Intensity**: Explore how the ratio of floating-point operations to memory traffic (operational intensity) determines whether applications are memory-bound or compute-bound, and understand its implications for optimization strategies.

3. **Compare Architectural Characteristics**: Examine different processor architectures (Apple Silicon, Intel Xeon, NVIDIA GPU) through their roofline characteristics, understanding the trade-offs between memory bandwidth and peak compute capabilities.

4. **Identify Performance Bottlenecks**: Learn to plot application performance points and analyze whether applications are limited by memory bandwidth or computational capability, enabling targeted optimization approaches.

5. **Develop Optimization Strategies**: Gain insights into how to optimize applications based on their position in the roofline space, including techniques for increasing operational intensity, improving memory utilization, and maximizing compute resource usage.

6. **Explore Real-world Applications**: Understand how modern high-performance computing, machine learning, and scientific applications can be analyzed and optimized using roofline methodology for various hardware platforms.
